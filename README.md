**Source URL**: http://arch.k12.hi.us/reports/ssir

This repository contains all PDFs of the School Status & Improvement Reports for school year 2019-2020, the latest available (`pdfs` folder).

It also contains extracts of page 5 of the reports, which includes data on teaching and administrative staff (`extracted_p5` folder).

Files are named with the school code. See `schools.csv` to see the code for each school, along with the original URL.

Note: SSIRs are not available for 37 schools—mostly charter schools—which are noted in `schools.csv`. They are available for all 257 other public schools.

> One of several major accountability reports produced annually by the DOE, the School Status & Improvement Report (SSIR) addresses standard-based education reporting requirements in §302A-1004, Hawaii Revised Statutes. The DOE prepares an individual SSIR for each school. Each school report contains a description of the school and its setting, a summary of school improvement progress, available resources, and vital signs on school performance.
